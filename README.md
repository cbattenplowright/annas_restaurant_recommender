# Anna's Restaurant Recommender - ARE YOU HUNGRY? JUST SEARCH 
## Description
This is a data API project which recommends London restaurants based on location and cuisine. Each restaurant contains a borough, cuisine, price range and rating (out of 5), as well as a list of dishes that are served. Dishes are characterised by whether they meet certain dietary requirements, such as being halal or vegetarian. 

The program allows for the user to be recommended restaurants based on their borough of choice, cuisine of choice, or both borough and cuisine at once. 

## MVP

Each model - Restaurant and Dish - have REST controllers that provide basic CRUD functionality:

**For Restaurants:**
- Create a new restaurant 
- Display all available restaurants
- Display details of a specific restaurant
- Update the details of a specific restaurant
- Delete a restaurant

**For Dishes:**
- Create a new dish
- Display all available dishes
- Display details of a specific dish
- Delete a dish

**Filtering**

The user is able to get a list of restaurants based on borough and cuisine. The names of those are defined in the following ENUM files:

- Boroughs: `annas_restaurant_recommender/models/Borough.java`
- Cuisines: `annas_restaurant_recommender/models/Cuisine.java`

In order to for the filters to operate ONLY values from those enums can be used.
